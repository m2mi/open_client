To download the cerificate of a website:

#> echo -n | openssl s_client -connect HOST:PORTNUMBER | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > /tmp/$SERVERNAME.cert

That will save the certificate to /tmp/$SERVERNAME.cert.

You can use -showcerts if you want to download all the certificates in the chain.
